### Hi there 👋

I'm Jehson. I've been 👨🏻‍💻 coding since 🤘 Y2K, back when some 💾 disks were floppy, and inside the 🐁 mouse, there was a 🎱 ball.

At the moment, I am working with full-stack code, from MySQL, vanilla PHP and Python to Typescript/Angular, and even Jenkins/CI, Terraform, and Puppet, in a dire attempt to modernise a time-proven freelancing platform, home to 50+ million users, scaled globally.
